# INF2005ACW

Design and develop an LSB Replacement steganography program, written in a language of your choice (eg. Python, C, Java) 

Program Requirements:
- Support steganographic encode and decode of a TEXT payload with cover objects: 📷 image (JPG, PNG), and 📽️ audio-visual files (WAV)
- Number of LSBs to use from cover object bits 1 to 8 and integrated as part of GUI for user selection, starting from bit 0
- Drag and drop, and explorer-type functionality as part of GUI to select cover/ stego objects/ payload 
- GUI able to display and play payload/ cover/ stego objects

💡In my case, I chose to use Python in Streamlit environment as it has built-in widgets for convenient customization
